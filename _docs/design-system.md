# Design System Inspired by MongoDB

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

MongoDB's website is a deep-forest-meets-terminal experience — a design system rooted in the darkest teal-black (`#001e2b`) that evokes both the density of a database and the depth of a forest canopy. Against this near-black canvas, a striking neon green (`#00ed64`) pulses as the brand accent — bright enough to feel electric, organic enough to feel alive. This isn't the cold neon of cyberpunk; it's the bioluminescent green of something growing in the dark.

The typography system is architecturally ambitious: DM Serif Text for massive hero headlines (96px) creates an editorial, authoritative presence — serif type at database-company scale is a bold choice that says "we're not just another tech company." Plus Jakarta Sans handles the heavy lifting of body and UI text with an unusually wide weight range (300–700), while Source Code Pro serves as the code and label font with distinctive uppercase treatments featuring very wide letter-spacing (1px–3px). This three-font system creates a hierarchy that spans editorial elegance → geometric professionalism → engineering precision.

What makes MongoDB distinctive is its dual-mode design: a dark hero/feature section world (`#001e2b` with neon green accents) and a light content world (white with teal-gray borders `#b8c4c2`). The transition between these modes creates dramatic contrast. The shadow system uses teal-tinted dark shadows (`rgba(0, 30, 43, 0.12)`) that maintain the forest-dark atmosphere even on light surfaces. Buttons use pill shapes (100px–999px radius) with MongoDB Green borders (`#00684a`), and the entire component system references the LeafyGreen design system.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Deep teal-black backgrounds (`#001e2b`) — forest-dark, not space-dark
- Neon MongoDB Green (`#00ed64`) as the singular brand accent — electric and organic
- DM Serif Text for hero headlines — editorial authority at tech scale
- Plus Jakarta Sans for body with weight 300 (light) as a distinctive body weight
- Source Code Pro with wide uppercase letter-spacing (1px–3px) for technical labels
- Teal-tinted shadows: `rgba(0, 30, 43, 0.12)` — shadows carry the forest color
- Dual-mode: dark teal hero sections + light white content sections
- Pill buttons (100px radius) with green borders (`#00684a`)
- Link Blue (`#006cfa`) and hover transition to `#3860be`

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary Brand
- **Forest Black** (`#001e2b`): Primary dark background — the deepest teal-black
- **MongoDB Green** (`#00ed64`): Primary brand accent — neon green for highlights, underlines, gradients

### Shadows
- **Forest Shadow** (`rgba(0, 30, 43, 0.12) 0px 26px 44px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.13) 0px 7px 13px`): Primary card elevation — teal-tinted
- **Standard Shadow** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) 0px 3px 20px`): General elevation
- **Subtle Shadow** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 2px 4px`): Light card lift

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Families
- **Display Serif**: `DM Serif Text` — editorial hero headlines
- **Body / UI**: `Plus Jakarta Sans` — geometric sans-serif workhorse
- **Code / Labels**: `Source Code Pro` — monospace with uppercase label treatments
- **Fallbacks**: `Work Sans` (with CJK: Noto Sans KR/SC/JP), `Times`, `Arial`, `system-ui`

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display Hero | DM Serif Text | 96px (6.00rem) | 400 | 1.20 (tight) | normal | Serif authority |
| Display Secondary | DM Serif Text | 64px (4.00rem) | 400 | 1.00 (tight) | normal | Serif sub-hero |
| Section Heading | Plus Jakarta Sans | 36px (2.25rem) | 500 | 1.33 | normal | Geometric precision |
| Sub-heading | Plus Jakarta Sans | 24px (1.50rem) | 500 | 1.33 | normal | Feature titles |
| Body Large | Plus Jakarta Sans | 20px (1.25rem) | 400 | 1.60 (relaxed) | normal | Introductions |
| Body | Plus Jakarta Sans | 18px (1.13rem) | 400 | 1.33 | normal | Standard body |
| Body Light | Plus Jakarta Sans | 16px (1.00rem) | 300 | 1.50–2.00 | normal | Light-weight reading text |
| Nav / UI | Plus Jakarta Sans | 16px (1.00rem) | 500 | 1.00–1.88 | 0.16px | Navigation, emphasized |
| Body Bold | Plus Jakarta Sans | 15px (0.94rem) | 700 | 1.50 | normal | Strong emphasis |
| Button | Plus Jakarta Sans | 13.5px–16px | 500–700 | 1.00 | 0.135px–0.9px | CTA labels |
| Caption | Plus Jakarta Sans | 14px (0.88rem) | 400 | 1.71 (relaxed) | normal | Metadata |
| Small | Plus Jakarta Sans | 11px (0.69rem) | 600 | 1.82 (relaxed) | 0.2px | Tags, annotations |
| Code Heading | Source Code Pro | 40px (2.50rem) | 400 | 1.60 (relaxed) | normal | Code showcase titles |
| Code Body | Source Code Pro | 16px (1.00rem) | 400 | 1.50 | normal | Code blocks |
| Code Label | Source Code Pro | 14px (0.88rem) | 400–500 | 1.14 (tight) | 1px–2px | `text-transform: uppercase` |
| Code Micro | Source Code Pro | 9px (0.56rem) | 600 | 2.67 (relaxed) | 2.5px | `text-transform: uppercase` |

### Principles
- **Serif for authority**: DM Serif Text at hero scale creates an editorial presence unusual in tech — it communicates that MongoDB is an institution, not a startup.
- **Weight 300 as body default**: Plus Jakarta Sans uses light (300) for body text, creating an airy reading experience that contrasts with the dense, dark backgrounds.
- **Wide-tracked monospace labels**: Source Code Pro uppercase at 1px–3px letter-spacing creates technical signposts that feel like database field labels — systematic, structured, classified.
- **Four-weight range**: 300 (light body) → 400 (standard) → 500 (UI/nav) → 700 (bold CTA) — a wider range than most systems, enabling fine-grained hierarchy.

- MongoDB logo (leaf icon + wordmark) left-aligned
- Green CTA pill buttons right-aligned
- Mega-menu dropdowns with product categories

### Image Treatment
- Dashboard screenshots on dark backgrounds
- Green-accented UI elements in screenshots
- 30px–32px radius on image containers
- Full-width dark sections for product showcases

### Distinctive Components

**Neon Green Accent Underlines**
- `0px 2px 2px 0px solid #00ed64` — bottom + right border creating accent underlines
- Used on feature headings and highlighted text
- Also appears as `#006cfa` (blue) variant

**Source Code Label System**
- 14px uppercase Source Code Pro with 1px–2px letter-spacing
- Used as section category markers above headings
- Creates a "database field label" aesthetic

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 1px, 4px, 7px, 8px, 10px, 12px, 14px, 15px, 16px, 18px, 20px, 24px, 32px

### Grid & Container
- Max content width centered
- Dark hero section with contained content
- Light content sections below
- Card grids: 2–3 columns
- Full-width dark footer

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Dramatic mode transitions**: The shift from dark teal sections to white content creates built-in visual breathing through contrast, not just space.
- **Generous dark sections**: Dark hero and feature areas use extra vertical padding (80px+) to let the forest-dark background breathe.
- **Compact light sections**: White content areas are denser, with tighter card grids and less vertical spacing.

### Border Radius Scale
- Minimal (1px–2px): Small spans, badges
- Subtle (4px): Inputs, small buttons
- Standard (8px): Cards, links
- Card (16px): Standard cards, containers
- Toggle (20px): Switch elements
- Large (24px): Large panels
- Image (30px–32px): Image containers
- Hero (48px): Hero cards
- Pill (100px–999px): Buttons, navigation pills
- Full (9999px): Maximum pill

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow | Default surfaces |
| Subtle (Level 1) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0px 2px 4px` | Light card lift |
| Standard (Level 2) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.15) 0px 3px 9px` | Standard cards |
| Prominent (Level 3) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.15) 0px 3px 20px` | Elevated panels |
| Forest (Level 4) | `rgba(0,30,43,0.12) 0px 26px 44px, rgba(0,0,0,0.13) 0px 7px 13px` | Hero cards — teal-tinted |

**Shadow Philosophy**: MongoDB's shadow system is unique in that the primary elevation shadow uses `rgba(0, 30, 43, 0.12)` — a teal-tinted shadow that carries the forest-dark brand color into the depth system. This means even on white surfaces, shadows feel like they belong to the MongoDB color world rather than being generic neutral black.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use `#001e2b` (forest-black) for dark sections — not pure black
- Apply MongoDB Green (`#00ed64`) sparingly for maximum electric impact
- Use DM Serif Text ONLY for hero/display headings — Plus Jakarta Sans for everything else
- Apply Source Code Pro uppercase with wide tracking (1px–3px) for technical labels
- Use teal-tinted shadows (`rgba(0,30,43,0.12)`) for primary card elevation
- Maintain the dark/light section duality — dramatic contrast between modes
- Use weight 300 for body text — the light weight is the readable voice
- Apply pill radius (100px) to primary action buttons

### Don't
- Don't use pure black (`#000000`) for dark backgrounds — always use teal-black (`#001e2b`)
- Don't use MongoDB Green (`#00ed64`) on backgrounds — it's an accent for text, underlines, and small highlights
- Don't use standard gray shadows — always use teal-tinted (`rgba(0,30,43,...)`)
- Don't apply serif font to body text — DM Serif Text is hero-only
- Don't use narrow letter-spacing on Source Code Pro labels — the wide tracking IS the identity
- Don't mix dark and light section treatments within the same section
- Don't use warm colors — the palette is strictly cool (teal, green, blue)
- Don't forget the green accent underlines — they're the signature decorative element

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile Small | <425px | Tight single column |
| Mobile | 425–768px | Standard mobile |
| Tablet | 768–1024px | 2-column grids begin |
| Desktop | 1024–1280px | Standard layout |
| Large Desktop | 1280–1440px | Expanded layout |
| Ultra-wide | >1440px | Maximum width, generous margins |

### Touch Targets
- Pill buttons with generous padding
- Navigation links at 16px with adequate spacing
- Card surfaces as full-area touch targets

### Collapsing Strategy
- Hero: DM Serif Text 96px → 64px → scales further
- Navigation: horizontal mega-menu → hamburger
- Feature cards: multi-column → stacked
- Dark/light sections maintain their mode at all sizes
- Source Code Pro labels maintain uppercase treatment

### Image Behavior
- Dashboard screenshots scale proportionally
- Dark section backgrounds maintained full-width
- Image radius maintained across breakpoints

### Iteration Guide
1. Start with the mode decision: dark (#001e2b) for hero/features, white for content
2. MongoDB Green (#00ed64) is electric — use once per section for maximum impact
3. Serif headlines (DM Serif Text) create the editorial authority — never use for body
4. Weight 300 body text creates the airy reading experience — don't default to 400
5. Source Code Pro uppercase with wide tracking for technical labels — the database voice
6. Teal-tinted shadows keep everything in the MongoDB color world

## 10. Geodocs Adaptation Layer

This section defines how to apply the MongoDB-inspired system specifically to geodocs.dev.

v1 scope boundary:
- Use this design system as directional guidance, not as a full reskin mandate.
- In v1, prioritize content semantics, hierarchy, CTA language, and role clarity.
- Full token-level retheme (palette/typography overhaul) is deferred to v1.1.

### 10.1 Product Personality

Geodocs voice should feel:
- Strategic and operator-grade, not generic blog tone
- Tactical and executable, not academic theory
- Fast and decisive, optimized for people under delivery pressure

### 10.2 Brand CI + ICP

Primary ICP:
- SEO/GEO specialists and developers implementing GEO/AEO workflows

Secondary ICP:
- Marketing managers/founders and content creators adapting to AI search behavior

Machine audience:
- AI agents and bots as first-class readers that parse and cite markdown content

Design implication:
- Every major homepage section must answer one question from this ICP:
	- What changed?
	- What should I do now?
	- How do I prove impact?

Brand CI requirements:
- Promise clarity: every landing surface communicates "definitive GEO/AEO reference for humans and AI agents"
- Artifact-first: every strategic page links to at least one checklist/template/script
- Role-first labels: menu and CTAs must prioritize task/role comprehension over technical naming
- Machine readability: heading structure and metadata must remain stable for automated parsing

### 10.3 Homepage Semantic Mapping (Existing Layout)

Keep current layout skeleton. Change semantics and content intent.

Hero block intent:
- Replace product-centric language with GEO transition urgency
- Promise: move from ranking-centric SEO to citation-centric AI visibility

Guides block intent:
- "Popular GEO Playbooks" (action-first links)

Samples block intent:
- "Proposal Templates and Tactical Briefs" (artifact-first links)

SDK/API style blocks intent:
- Reframe as "Tooling and Standards" for GEO workflows
- Avoid developer-only framing terms unless needed for tactical implementation

### 10.4 Component Content Rules

Headlines:
- One strategic claim + one execution cue
- Avoid vague trend language

Subtext:
- Max 2 lines per card where possible
- Include role cue when relevant (e.g. "for SEO specialists", "for developers")

CTAs:
- Verb + outcome ("Start your GEO audit", "Use the citation checklist")
- Prefer action language over navigation language

Cards:
- Must map to one of 3 jobs:
	- Understand
	- Execute
	- Prove

## 11. Editorial Voice System (for Homepage + Articles)

### 11.1 Tone

- Direct and practical
- Confident, never hype-heavy
- Specific over inspirational

### 11.2 Style

- Answer-first opening
- Frameworks, checklists, tables, scripts
- Short paragraphs and strong section headers

### 11.3 Article Structural Template

Recommended structure:
1. What changed now
2. Why this matters for the reader role
3. 3-5 step framework
4. Tactical checklist or script
5. Measurement guidance
6. "Do this this week" close

### 11.4 Content Quality Bar

Every page should include at least one concrete decision artifact:
- A checklist
- A comparison table
- A script/template
- A priority matrix

If it cannot drive a decision in under 10 minutes, it is not ready.

## 12. Do/Don't for Geodocs Content UI

Do:
- Keep high contrast hierarchy and dark/light transitions
- Use green accent for strategic emphasis only
- Prioritize role clarity in headings and CTA labels
- Align card groups to user jobs (understand, execute, prove)

Don't:
- Revert to generic dev docs semantics on homepage
- Overload hero with more than one primary promise
- Use decorative visual elements with no content function
- Publish long-form articles without at least one tactical artifact

## 13. Navigation and Category System (Scale to 1000 Articles)

Top navigation (max 9 items):
- Start Here
- Playbooks
- Checklists
- Comparisons
- Case Signals
- Templates
- Standards
- Tools
- Community

Taxonomy model:
- L1 journey: Fundamentals, Strategy, Execution, Proof, Operations
- L2 role: SEO Specialist, Marketing Manager, Developer, Content Creator, AI Agent
- L3 artifact: Checklist, Template, Script, Matrix, SOP, Brief

UI rules:
- Show L1 as primary nav context
- Show L2 role chip at top of article page
- Show L3 artifact badge near title and in cards
- Keep role switcher visible on guide and resource hubs

## 14. Content Ops Interface Rules (External Repo Workflow)

Source-of-truth model:
- Authoring happens in external repo ../geodocs.dev-docs
- geodocs.dev-ui is the published product layer
- Existing sample articles are optional reference only and can be removed during reset

Operational UI requirements:
- Each article page must display: last reviewed date, owner, artifact type
- Pages missing required metadata should be excluded from production nav
- Draft labels must be visibly distinct from published guidance

Review status indicators:
- Verified: reviewed within target window
- Needs refresh: beyond review SLA
- Draft: not yet approved for production-facing navigation

From-scratch reset rule:
- Prefer clean category-consistent pages over retrofitting legacy sample structure.
- If a sample page cannot fit taxonomy without heavy rewrite, replace it with a new canonical page.
