## Styleguides

### Commit Messages

The commit messages should follow the following pattern:

```bash
feat: Description # if a new feature is added
fix: Description # if a bug is fixed
refactor: Description # if code is refactored
docs: Description # if documentation is added
lint: Description # if a lint issue is fixed
```

### Issues

```bash
update: Description # if an update is required for a feature
bug: Description # if there is a bug in a particular feature
suggestion: Description # if you want to suggest a better way to implement a feature
```

### Code Styleguide

The code should satisfy the following:

- Have meaningful variable names, either in `snake_case` or `camelCase`.
- Have no `lint` issues.
- Have meaningful file names, directory names and directory structure.
- Have a scope for easy fixing, refactoring and scaling.

## What should I know before I get started

You can contribute to any of the features you want, here's what you need to know:

- How the project works.
- The technology stack used for the project.
- A brief idea about writing documentation.

## How Can I Contribute

You can contribute by:

- Reporting Bugs
- Suggesting Enhancements
- Code Contribution
- Pull Requests

## Code Contribution

1. Start from the latest `main`.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Run local docs: `npm start`.
5. Run checks before committing:

```sh
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

6. Stage only intended files: `git add <file1> <file2>`.
7. Commit with conventional format, for example: `git commit -m "feat: add geo audit checklist docs"`.
8. Push your branch: `git push -u origin feature/my-new-feature`.
9. Open a pull request.

### Pull Requests

Make sure to document the contributions well in the pull request.
Pull requests should have:

- A concise commit message.
- A description of what was changed/added.

Others will give constructive feedback.
This is a time for discussion and improvements,
and making the necessary changes will be required before we can
merge the contribution.

### Release and Documentation Cadence

For release sequencing and documentation standards, follow:

- [./_docs/RELEASE-CADENCE.md](./_docs/RELEASE-CADENCE.md)

In short:

1. Work on a feature branch.
2. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build`.
3. Run `/document-release` before merge to keep docs in sync with shipped changes.
